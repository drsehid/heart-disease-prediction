# Description

In this project, we are required to predict whether a patient has a high or low chance of having a heart attack based on the medical information provided in detail below. The data is saved in the file `heart.csv`.

9. Result of rest ECG (`rest_ecg`)
  - 0: Normal

10. Maximum heart rate achieved (`thalach`)
11. Chance of heart attack (`target`)
  - 0: Low chance
  - 1: High chance
